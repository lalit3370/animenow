What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama\'s award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.', 'Oh dear Shingeki no Kyojin, where do I even begin. If you\'ve talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What\'s the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it\'s on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that\'s simply because it\'s stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin \"overrated\" may not have the same taste as me, and that\'s perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin is one of if not the greatest anime to be made. It\'s not popular for no reason.\r\n\r\nThe story is one of the most captivating stories I\'ve ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 \"heavenly\" walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can\'t break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother\'s head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he\'d one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he\'s also something else that could be the key to humanity\'s survival, but could also be humanity\'s destruction. \r\n\r\nMy 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there\'s lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. \r\n\r\nCharacters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki\'s strongpoint. There\'s a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There\'s trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There\'s comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can\'t seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, \"scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real\" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he\'s cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and \"special\", but he\'s still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. \r\n\r\nThe art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people\'s eyes as well. A new form of action that\'s never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. \"They\'re the prey, and we are the hunters!\" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. \r\n\r\nOf course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What\'s so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven\'t already watched this anime and you\'re reading this review, then you\'ve clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn\'t your style of anime.', 'animeimages\\attackontitan.jpg'),
(2, 'Clannad: After Story', NULL, 'Clannad: After Story', 'series', 1, 24, 9.00, 'Kyoto Animation', 'finished', '00:23:00', '2008-10-03', 'Clannad: After Story, the sequel to the critically acclaimed slice-of-life series Clannad, begins after Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa graduate from high school. Together, they experience the emotional rollercoaster of growing up. Unable to decide on a course for his future, Tomoya learns the value of a strong work ethic and discovers the strength of Nagisa\'s support. Through the couple\'s dedication and unity of purpose, they push forward to confront their personal problems, deepen their old relationships, and create new bonds.\r\n\r\nTime also moves on in the Illusionary World. As the plains grow cold with the approach of winter, the Illusionary Girl and the Garbage Doll are presented with a difficult situation that reveals the World\'s true purpose.\r\n\r\nBased on the visual novel by Key and produced by Kyoto Animation, Clannad: After Story is an impactful drama highlighting the importance of family and the struggles of adulthood.', 'I laughed...\r\nI cried...\r\nI experienced something that changed my life... \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Clannad ~After Story~ influenced the way I will live for the rest of my life and not just in some half-assed way like any other show would. It legitimately moved me to make certain decisions, for better or for worse. In that sense, no other anime can compare, as no other anime has provided an equivalent reaction on my part.\r\n\r\nBefore you continue, you should know that Clannad ~After Story~ is a continuation of the story from Clannad and an adaptation from the original Visual Novel by KEY. Although knowledge of the first season is not necessary, it is highly recommended if you want to get the most out of ~After Story~ as well as this review. That being said, this review is tailored to all readers, and can be understood without knowledge of the first season. Note that there may be very minor spoilers. Now then, on to the meat and potatoes.\r\n\r\nI won\'t spend much time on the individual components of Clannad ~After Story~ (or Clannad ~AS~ as I will call it now) like I have with my other reviews. At first glance, there is nothing notably outstanding about it as a whole. For those who are interested in the individual components, here they are and the reasons behind them are available at the end of the review:\r\n\r\nStory: 8.7/10\r\nArt/Animation: 8.4/10\r\nSound: 7.8/10\r\nCharacter: 9.7/10\r\nEnjoyment (in this case influence): 10+/10 \r\nOverall: 9.8/10\r\n\r\n\r\n| Main Review |\r\nIt is difficult to convey the emotions that went through my mind as I watched Clannad ~AS~. For those of you who watched the first season and dropped the show, I urge you to pick up ~AS~ and give it a chance. The first few episodes run almost identically to those of the first season, but the true After Story part branches off in a manner that is unique only to ~AS~. What Clannad ~AS~ gives the viewer is a story of life. A story of despair. A story of forgiveness. A story of hope. Through this story, Clannad ~AS~ can powerfully change the way you perceive the world around you. I am well aware that not everyone enjoys Clannad and ~AS~, especially since the magical light orbs are outlandish to some, but for me it was a bit of a godsend among anime.\r\n\r\nThe concept of Clannad ~AS~ is neither truly unique nor breathtakingly wonderful. What the viewer gets when watching it is the story of a man. Nothing less and nothing more. What Clannad ~AS~ really excels at, however, is the way it tells the story of that man. While it may be classified as a romance or even a harem anime by some (at least the first season could be), I really classify Clannad ~AS~ as a slice of life. A slice out of the life of a delinquent who can’t seem to do anything right and struggles to protect what really matters to him as the world comes crashing down.\r\n\r\nHowever, “slice of life” can be a deceptive term. As I watched Clannad ~AS~, it was not as much a slice out of Tomoya’s life but a slice out of mine. You see, what Kyoani succeeds in is hitting on the points that make life truly what it is. The continuation of time. The reality of truth. The genuine meaning of “life goes on.” Additionally, by extending over many years, the true significance of every event begins to emerge. Clannad ~AS~ takes the tale of the first season and shapes it around a single person. It is a respectable reflection of life and delves into what many shows do not, and cannot, represent: the story after the story. \r\n\r\nWhile many of the situations may be overblown and excessively dramatized (at least in the opinion of some people), it is ultimately true that every facet of Clannad ~AS~ gives the audience some insight into life. Does it matter that there are miracles and magic orbs of light flying around? For me, no. For others, this could be the case. That is to say, not all aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are perfect, but the impact was enough for me. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a cheerful anime, turn away now. Kyoto Animation does many things with Clannad ~AS~ including some very effective humor in many places, but Clannad ~AS~ will make you cry and smile, often both in the same episode. I won’t lie, I cried at least 5 times throughout the season. Even when rewatching episodes, I cried again. Don’t get me wrong, Clannad ~AS~ really has some happy moments as well, but Kyoani tends to depress many, many times. Each sad moment is profound and beautiful, but nevertheless it is sad. The ending song, Torch, which is played in every episode, serves to alleviate this, for better or worse. Torch is very upbeat, but many people consider it unnecessary and I agree. Torch can be a real mood breaker at times.\r\n\r\nThe power that Clannad ~AS~ exerts comes from its characters. While the first season portrayed many main characters and their stories, ~AS~ focuses on the life of Tomoya and lightly on the lives of those who surround him. Tomoya is a failure in a cruel world. In a sense, he is a fatal hero. While he may not know it, he is destined to face pain and suffering through his life. There is a bit of controversy over the ending of ~AS~, but those who wish to have a “truer” ending can consider the second to last episode as such (don’t hate me for suggesting it). When seen in that light, Clannad ~AS~ effectively played out a story that neither catered to an audience nor skewed reality (except for the orbs of light, of course). What it presented was something that many people can relate to. The loss of a loved one. The pain of recovery. The neglect of a father. Rediscovering love and friendship. Coping with suffering. *SPOILER* The feeling of holding a daughter in your arms for the first time. The pains and joys of being a father. */SPOLER* What it ended with was a realistic ending and a message for the future. Additionally, if seen that way, the last episode can be portrayed as Kyoani staying true to the visual novel and respecting the source material.\r\n\r\n*Unfortunately, more talk of the plot would undeniably lead to spoilers, which I am trying to keep free from this review, so please bear with me. Heck, if I’ve convinced you at this point, what are you waiting for? Go see for yourself what all the hype is about. Otherwise, read on!*\r\n\r\nUltimately, Clannad ~AS~ molded characters that I thought I was familiar with into something close to human. Their stories produced emotion that made me reconsider the situations of the people that I see every day. Through social commentary and moral struggles, the viewer can genuinely begin to respect Tomoya. I know I wouldn’t be able to withstand half of what he did, but I truly began to respect the fact that he kept going, despite him being a fictional character. Through his struggles, I began to learn about myself. Through the struggles of those around him, I began to respect those whom I had once hated. This may seem extreme, and you may think that I am crazy, but what I write is nothing but the truth. Every episode gripped me, and many episodes evoked tearful reactions, which I am not very prone to. As I continued to watch, I could hardly bear waiting a week for each new episode to come out. At the same time, however, I knew that each episode held a bomb - a flood of emotions that could affect the rest of my day. Clannad ~AS~ went way beyond enjoyment – it went into the realm of what I could call an “epiphany.”\r\n\r\nCan the story of one man influence the lives of others? Is it still possible if that man is a fictional character? For me, I did not think it was possible for anime to extend its influence at such a level. Clannad ~AS~ proved me wrong time and time again. Look past the first season and the first few episodes, and perhaps you can begin to understand what I mean. \r\n\r\nFor those interested or who can relate after watching the show, this is the ultimate and most powerful result of the show as it applies to me. The following is the reason why I can’t keep my mind off of Clannad ~AS~ and the reason why it will remain as my #1 favorite for what I know will be many, many seasons: *SPOILER* Through Clannad ~AS~, I have basically committed to wanting to have a baby. Ushio love. */SPOILER*\r\n\r\n\r\n| Analysis of components |\r\nStory:\r\nClannad ~AS~ is unique in its storytelling, but the story itself is nothing special. The earlier episodes present almost unrelated stories just as the first season did, but Clannad ~AS~ takes a turn for the better with a focus on a single character and his ordeal. At this point, Clannad ~AS~ does nothing but follow the life of a young adult, Tomoya. Sure there is drama (oh, is there drama) and there is romance, in a sense, but in reality, there is no real plot to speak of. What there is, however, is the tale of a life experience that can change the way you live. A real deterrent might come from some of the magic that inexplicably finds its way into Clannad (both seasons), but that never really bothered me. The ending is also less-than-stellar and can be a bit confusing, but as stated before, there’s always the second to last episode to fall back on.\r\n\r\nArt/Animation:\r\nThere is nothing blatantly wrong with the animation quality. Kyoto Animation produced Clannad ~AS~, so fans will know that there is nothing to fear. The character design is the same as that of Clannad and other KEY adaptations. The KEY character design is quite distinguishable, with its giant eyes. Personally, I am a fan, but other viewers might dislike the artwork. Other than that, Kyoani did another solid job with the animation, and there are no jerky movements that detract from the gorgeous lessons that unfold.\r\n\r\nSound:\r\nKyoani had its ups and downs with the music for Clannad ~AS~. In many aspects, Clannad ~AS~ shoots beyond other KEY adaptations with its unique, unconventional plotline and incredibly well enacted scenes of what could very well be the life of an individual. In fact, many of the ordeals that Tomoya must face strike a particularly strong emotional chord among many people. Who knows, you might not be that certain type of person, but I definitely was. Anyways… back to the music. Clannad ~AS~’s opening sequence is a strong piano melody with deceptively deep lyrics. However, the ending sequence detracts from many of the spectacular moments, especially because Kyoani tends to end episodes on a sad note. As such, many would classify Torch (the ED) as an elaborate troll because it is too lively. Beyond the OP and ED, Clannad ~AS~ features tracks from the Visual Novel, which include very familiar tracks from the first season. Notable among these are the songs with lyrics, ie Ana. Certain parts of the OST mesh very well, and a powerful soundtrack can produce a powerful reaction. However, I don’t remember anything in particular clearly standing out to me, and as previously mentioned, Torch ruined quite a few strong moments.\r\n\r\nCharacter:\r\nWhile most of the other aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are very similar to their counterparts in the first season, character development in ~AS~ take a turn for the better. Kyoani successfully made me hate characters that I loved and love characters that I hated. Through a roller coaster complete with dips and turns, Clannad ~AS~ changed the way I perceive all type of people. From Tomoya’s seemingly disinterested, alcoholic father to Nagisa, a character who I actually deemed annoying in the first season, I came to understand what truly makes up a person. Every character really has a story behind their dejected or cheerful façade. Despite the usual “Clannad magic,” every character also turned out to be associable, adding to the personal level of the show. Even the more comical, secondary characters had their share of emotional moments, giving them real depth and giving the viewer a relatively accurate understanding of human nature. About half-way through the show, there is a certain character that changes many, many things. I won’t spoil it now, but her unique appearance is what truly brought Clannad ~AS~ to unmatchable levels.\r\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\r\nEnjoyment is really up to the beholder. My view of enjoyment may be somewhat different from others’. Clannad is not for everybody, but for those who dropped the first season, ~AS~ is truly on a league of its own and worth another shot. Every person has that one anime that leaps up above the rest and leaves a lasting impression. For me, that anime was Clannad ~AS~. No other words can describe the effect it had on me, and I hope that this review has at least made you, the reader, consider picking up this diamond in the rough.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Final Thoughts |\r\nThank you for your time (I know the review was long), and I sincerely wish that you give Clannad ~AS~ a chance. Who knows, it may change your life. As always, comments about how effectively this review worked are welcome. Also, a helpful rating is always appreciated.', 'animeimages\\clannadas.jpg'),
(12, 'Death Note', NULL, 'Death Note', 'series', 1, 37, 8.67, 'Madhouse', 'finished', '00:23:00', '2006-10-04', 'A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim\'s face and write their victim\'s name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm.\r\n\r\nHigh school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal\'s name in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be. \r\n\r\nWith this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric man known only by the name of L.', 'Death Note is definitely one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. I can truly say it is one of the best, if not the best anime I\'ve watched.\r\n\r\nStory: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind (I left out the details that you don\'t care about). This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly. \r\n\r\nBut this debatable topic isn\'t the series strong point. Death Note gets a 10 in the story department, because of the way the plot unravels. With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. You will not be disappointed. \r\n\r\nThe flaws begin once it is apparent that there will be a second arc. This to me, seemed like an unnecessary way of drawing out the anime, although arguably a change in situation was required to break the dead lock between Light and L. Anyhow, the series being to lose some of its luster at this point, and if I were to rate both arcs separately, the first would receive a 15/10 and the second a 9/10. Anyhow, this intelligent story deserves an overall 10/10 in my books. \r\n\r\nCharacters: Light and L are the most interesting and intellectual characters I\'ve ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light\'s charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L\'s quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development is also seen, particularly with Light as you witness his calm, calculating figure being to crack into a maddening and reckless mess. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, he changes greatly from the beginning of the series. This change can be seen in various other characters as well, although not as notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting enough to give this a: 9/10\r\n\r\nSound: Yet another brilliant aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more so as the characters attempt to read each other. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light\'s character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. But as you continue to watch the series you will notice just how well it fits Light\'s demented mind and how everything he has achieved beings to shatter around his feet. 9.5/10 (rounded to 10)\r\n\r\nArt/Animation: And again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the characters and scenery are all done amazingly well. I mean, the anime made writing with a pen look cool. The way they made it zoom across that piece of paper ... In terms of animation, the pen wins. It truly does. But seriously, there isn\'t much action going on here, so there wasn\'t much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well. A 10/10\r\n\r\nOverall: I was watching the series since it first started coming out, and those weeks of waiting killed me. That was how good this anime was. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would have done with a Death Note. Many of them will question and argue about the actions of Light. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. You may hate it (although very few seem to), but it is definitely an anime you must TRY. 10/10', 'animeimages\\deathnote.jpg'),

They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward\'s right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse\'s soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\r\n\r\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher\'s Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher\'s Stone, but their country\'s murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.', 'First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there\'s only one word to describe this series - EPIC.\r\n\r\nI admit that as I\'ve seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing after watching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who\'s new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what\'s left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\r\n\r\nThe animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it\'s a bit simpler but that\'s just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\r\n\r\nThe voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\r\n\r\nMoving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we\'re familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers\' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I\'ve ever seen, and you\'d probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\r\n\r\nOne of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I\'m thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that\'s forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. \r\n\r\nFMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it\'s finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it\'s too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it\'s recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.', 'animeimages\\fmab.jpg'),

Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Yang—a strong supporter of democratic ideals—has to stand firm in his beliefs, despite the struggles of the FPA, and show his pupil, Julian Mintz, that autocracy is not the solution.\r\n\r\nAs ideologies clash amidst the war\'s many casualties, the two strategic masterminds must ask themselves what the real reason behind their battle is.\r\n', 'This series is overrated on this site. That is to say, with 110 episodes, your vote only counts after you\'ve seen 22 episodes, almost a full season, and those who don\'t like this show probably won\'t wait for 22 episodes to decide. \r\nWhich is a shame, as it\'s only after about 20 episodes that this series progresses from something that is slow, somewhat overly bombastic, and hinting at more to come to show itself to be one of the most intelligent pieces of anime that\'s been made to date.\r\n\r\nWhen I say \'intelligent\', I don\'t mean it to be cunning, surprising the viewer with unsuspected plot lines or new angles to view something. Nor does it delve deeply into some obscure theory of science or arts, bombarding the viewer with ideas he couldn\'t have come up with himself. In fact, there\'s absolutely nothing in this series that is wholly unexpected or very deep. What it has, though, is a sense of scale that\'s unsurpassed in any anime - or, for that matter, any television show - I\'ve seen.\r\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes centers around - you guessed it - a bunch of people who, according to populace at large that inhabits the fictional future this series plays in, are of heroic proportions. That is to say, heroic in a very classical sense, being possibly a negative thing as well as a positive. \r\nThe series is set in a future wherein the universe known to man is divided into two camps, the aristocratic and absolutist Galactic Empire, and the democratic Free Planets\' Alliance, who have been embroiled in a war for some time, seemingly\r\nbeing evenly matched. This balance is shattered when a military genius with a far-reaching ambition rises on the Imperial side, prompting the Alliance to, somewhat grudgingly, give ever greater backing to the most capable officer on their own side. Both men surround themselves with able staff, who become legends in their own right.\r\nIt sounds like your average hero of freedom-versus-tyrant story, but it turns out to be anything but. First of all, the heroes do have a sense of their own importance, but also the sense to question whether they are all that special, or whether the circumstances of their times have just brought them to a spotlight which people equal to them could never have aimed at. More importantly, the main question on which the whole series hinges remains an open one. This question is the age-old one of which is better, autocracy or democracy, the problem being that a good autocracy is usually better than a good democracy, but a bad autocracy being worse than a bad democracy. Within the happenings of the show, it becomes apparent that, militarily speaking, at least, a good autocracy has an edge over democracy in terms of speed and decisiveness, and this shows in how the series progresses. \r\nA large part of the series is devoted to showing the war and its subsequent smaller-scale rumblings. The war is fully shown from the side of the commanding officers - one of only a very few shows to do so - and does show an appropriate sense of scale. With battles involving thousands of battleships and millions of men, simple depictions of large-scale tactics take the place of views of the battlefield itself, and a considerable part of the show is, laudable, devoted to discussions on logistics and military intelligence. \r\nA larger part still, though, is devoted to discussions on politics, all within the greater autocracy versus democracy question. Again, these thoughts never go very deep, but what strikes one is that so very many possible variables are brought up. Almost any motive of rulers or the general populace that might affect a political decision is included at some point in the show, making me at least think to myself: \'They even thought of th&aacute;t one.\' The show does tend, here and there, to lean toward the old \'good soldier, bad politician\' clich&eacute;, but, overall, it really lacks a clear villain, instead showing each possible side (apart, perhaps, from religious fanatics) from every possible angle. Moreover, all this is shown within a future universe that is highly consistent over the full 110 episodes, even if differences between the warring sides tend to be somewhat exaggerated: in many cases whole societies seem to act a bit too much according to a somewhat radical ideology, only to make their following actions be true to form.\r\n\r\nThis being true to form applies also to most of the actions that, at first glance, seem to be overly dramatical, in the first place many of the actions of the dozen or so main protagonists. However, when thinking about the how and why of their actions, it usually becomes clear that they cannot have but acted as they did, according to cultural mores and individual character. A case in point would be the reliance of many Imperial officers on the character of some military commander to predict his battlefield tactics. This would seem lunacy, until it is remembered that the Imperial commanders are a tight-knit group, mostly of noble birth, and known to each other: each commander would know the peculiarities of all others, which become all the more predictable as the importance of gaining personal glory and honour in battle are taken into the equation. \r\nThis reliance on known characteristics of all personalities is also possible because the characters don\'t evolve all that much. Now, I\'ve never understood why \'character progression\' in general seems to mean having characters make a full volte-face, and I am, in fact, happy with a series that shows all characters as being fully grown, and fixed in their ways. Each has a specific role to play, and a mind-set that might be predictable, but is, again, true to form. This doesn\'t make the character shallow. Far from it: their characteristics mean that each takes a single position to a fitting extreme, making for interesting differences between the characters, and accompanying differences in outlook. \r\nThat said, it is indeed true that the characters may be somewhat flat, and quite a few seem to be included only to show a different point of view toward a specific situation or theory, but it is exactly this relative flatness that makes it possible for them to discuss so many situations.\r\n\r\nAs for the art, it is old and outdated, but that can\'t be held against the show. It is a shame that, mainly in the first season, the series is at times simply bad: persons walk in an awkward way, scenes are recycled, and even relative positions of facial structures change from frame to frame. There\'s no excuse for that. Technically, though, the art definitely gets better during the course of the show.\r\nIn fact, the show being old might be a boon. The creators have opted to make the drawing style relatively realistic, which fits the series splendidly. One has only to look at the manga to see how different it could have been: the style of the manga doesn\'t fit the show at all. \r\nReal points have to go to the design. Again, nothing is really innovative, from the spaceships to the almost 19th century looking setting to the uniforms of the soldiers. It is, however, solid, and consistent, and really brings the world to life. \r\n\r\nThe music is outstanding. It mainly consists of generally well-known classical compositions, which, granted, have been often used before, but never have they been used to such splendid effect: especially the use of pieces during battle sequences, fitting the individual scenes to the music, is a joy to watch.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, Legend of the Galactic Heroes never tries to be overly deep, and, though it tends to be somewhat bombastic, never loses itself to any glorification. It is slow and quite meticulous, focusing on a lot of details, and consists for the largest part of dialogue, not action. The story progresses slowly, and only after about a season\'s worth of episodes the real story starts to evolve. \r\nAnd this show never, ever tries to evoke an emotional response. The whole series is based on having the viewer have an intellectual understanding of what happens, not an emotional one. There are, thus, no cheap tricks to elicit emotional response, nothing overly dramatic (barring a few strokes of bombast), and no characteristics that make a main protagonist or villain.\r\nI can only applaud this, considering it a feat to produce such a good series without relying on drama. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is, in this sense, the absolute antithesis of my other personal favourite, Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, appealing to the rational side of the viewer, even when the protagonists act with all their vaunted \'foppery and whim\'.', 'animeimages\\GingaEiyuuDensetsu.jpg'),

For an anime that seems to do everything right, it isn\'t talked about a lot at a popular level. Neither has it been successful in garnering a fan base similar to that of SNK or SAO. I decided to write this review to do the show justice. If a show this good is still flying under your radar or if you are discouraged from watching this because of its \"childish appearance\" then reading this review is a must.\r\n\r\nStory:\r\nHxH is about a young boy named Gon who embarks on a journey to find his father. After learning that his father left him at a young age to become a Hunter, Gon decides to follow in his footsteps not only to find him, but also to see what was so special about the profession that made his father choose it over him. Although a story of finding one\'s father is simple, it is the path that is taken towards this end that makes the series truly special. HxH is made up of several arcs that are all extremely well-written, which brings me to the best part of the series, the writing. Hunter x Hunter (2011) boasts one of the finest writing in the world of shonen; the depth and flow of the story, enthralling characterizations, strong dialogue and impressive world-building are all crafted into a fascinating tale that can absorb viewers into lengthy marathons. \r\n\r\nThe amount of variety that is packed into HxH\'s story is also very impressive. HxH successfully dabbles in several genres in six story arcs tackling survival, fighting tournaments, crime thriller, virtual realities, war and politics. Not only that, the series is also able to undergo significant tonal shifts with ease (light to dark and vice versa). Sometimes, these shifts in tone occur after an arc ends though other times, it even occurs mid-arc. Another thing about HxH is that its arcs are connected with one another, with each arc naturally following the one before it. This creates a natural transition that highlights what the series really is, a journey. As for pacing and development, they are excellent. For the most part, HxH is very well paced. The series does a fantastic job at keeping its viewers engaged, time will fly by as you watch most episodes and you\'ll find yourself breezing through the show. Excluding two recap episodes, HxH has no filler episodes. Due to this, story progression is solid with the plot moving forward with each episode.\r\n\r\nAlthough HxH initially gives off a light hearted impression, it gives off a good one. Not the kind of “light heartedness” that makes you say “this is childish and below me” but the kind that appeals to everyone. HxH gives off that classic and charming shonen vibe that has been lost in recent years, and it does so with its head held up high. Eventually though, the series takes a dark turn. Although most HxH story arcs are light hearted, both Yorknew and the Chimera Ant arc are two of the best and darkest arcs shonen has to offer. Yorknew can be described as a dark thriller in a big city. The central theme of the arc is revenge and it is similar to Death Note in terms of thrill and atmosphere. On the other hand, the Chimera Ants arc can be described as an attempt by the Hunters Association to control an outbreak of a dangerous man-eating species. It is the darkest and most thematically powerful arc in the series tackling themes such as identity, human nature and survival of the fittest. The arc has drawn comparisons to Yu Yu Hakusho’s Chapter Black for its seinen-like nature and is similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, where the protagonists experience a strong sense of despair in the face of a vastly superior, hostile species. The series undergoes major tonal shifts in both arcs with the color palette, music, atmosphere and amount of violence changing significantly. \r\n\r\nHowever, what sets the series apart from other battle anime is its unorthodoxy and unpredictability. Shonen tropes and storytelling methods are undermined throughout the series. The main character for example, Gon, fails more than he succeeds. Power-ups based on emotion or willpower are non-existent and fighting in the series is radically different from other battle anime. The main protagonist is not the main focus of every arc either. At certain points in the series, you could even say that Gon has taken a supporting role, especially during the later portions of the CA arc where he isn\'t given as much focus due to the grand scope of the story. The standard battle anime formula of “lose-train-win” is also undermined. Although there is training, it does not always translate to a victory, nor does it propel the protagonists over or to the same level as their main adversaries in terms of strength. For the most part, the protagonists assume the underdog role. Although they have incredible potential, they are still kids who have a lot to learn. In terms of storytelling, unpredictable developments are commonplace. One thing that continues to amaze me with this show is how it leads viewers into thinking that the story will progress in this direction, only to change course and arrive at a completely different outcome. A good example of this would be the series\' arcs which often end in an anti-climatic manner. Basically, there are a lot of scenes and story developments that you won’t see coming because they defy conventional shonen storytelling or are unpredictable in their own right.\r\n\r\nThe series\' unorthodoxy can also be seen in its fights which are primarily cerebral. In addition to being well-executed, HxH fights are smart and involve a lot of strategy. Raw power is a factor but it is not the factor that decides battle outcomes, actual power (nen abilities), experience and strategy are all taken into account. If a main character is outclassed by an opponent in all or most categories, he is likely to lose. Moreover, main characters are not given any special treatment in combat. This smart approach to fighting is further enhanced by nen, a unique and complex power system held by defined rules. The concept of nen, its principles, aura types and many applications on the battlefield reveal the huge amount of thought that was put into it. I still remember having to pause episodes, even research a bit during its introduction, just to digest it in its entirety. \r\n\r\nThe appearance and writing of the series also create an effect of cognitive dissonance, the simplistic look of the show mentally conflicts with the brilliance and unorthodoxy of its writing. As new viewers delve deeper into HxH, they realize that there is much more to the show than its cover art and synopsis suggest. Expectations of the series being immature, simple or generic are progressively overturned as the show reveals its surprising underbelly.\r\n\r\nSound:\r\nAs for sound, HxH has a line of great soundtracks that started off decent but got better as the series progressed. With the exception of a few minor characters, the voice acting in this series is excellent. As a person who has never seen the old series it’s hard to believe that these aren\'t the original voices because they fit extremely well, especially those of Gon, Killua and Hisoka whose voice actors do a perfect job of capturing their characters. \r\n\r\nArt:\r\nHxH also has great art and animation. It amazes me how a long-running series like HxH delivers consistent quality animation episode after episode, especially during the fights. The series does a great job of capturing facial expressions and everything from the lighting, shading and colors adjust perfectly depending on the mood of the scene or the tone of the arc. As one reviewer (nagaiyume) said, the bright colors of the show might need some getting used to, though it is usually fans of the old series who have this problem. Personally, I think it fits the show perfectly. It adds to the charm of the series by complementing its sense of adventure, uplifting atmosphere and unique appeal as a shonen that looks simple but is actually remarkably deep. \r\n\r\nCharacters:\r\nAlthough HxH’s primary strength lies in its writing, its characters come pretty damn close. HxH has a huge cast of characters. They have quirks, dreams, inner demons, world views and overall, really likable personalities. To top it off, most of them don’t follow generic character archetypes. Although some may initially come across as “generic”, these assumptions are gradually undermined as the series progresses. \r\n\r\nIf there\'s one thing I want to emphasize in the character department it would be the series main villains. When it comes to characters, this is where the show shines the brightest. HxH villains are extremely well-written (with the exception of the Bomber who won\'t apply to most of what I\'ll say below). Not only are their characterizations independently impressive, they are also distinct from one another; no two villains are the same. This distinctness does not only apply within the series but outside of it. You won\'t find another Hisoka, Chrollo or Ant King in any other anime. This is what makes HxH villains so compelling, in addition to having really impressive characterizations, they are also original. Although I excluded one out of the four main villains from most of what I wrote above, all HxH villains do have one thing in common. Each villain strikes fear into audience, the series does a good job of establishing the level of danger these characters bring to the story and our protagonists. \r\n\r\nNegatives:\r\nHowever, while HxH is a great series it isn\'t perfect. The series doesn\'t have a strong start, it takes three episodes for show to get going. I\'ve seen a lot of people drop HxH early and it sucks because the first two episodes don\'t capture the series at all. Things start to get mildly interesting in the third episode, after that, the series just gets better and better. HxH also suffers from occasional BGM misuse. There are odd sound choices for some scenes. Sometimes they don’t really fit, other times they don’t fit it all. Lastly, the Chimera Ant arc also has minor issues with both Togashi and Madhouse to blame. Togashi’s fault lies in his writing during the middle of the CA arc which I think, pales in comparison to the rest of the series. HxH has made a name for itself for holding a consistent high level throughout its run; it’s a series that’s just so engaging and easy to marathon. However, I believe this consistency took a hit mid-CA arc (due to handling of the story and pacing) specifically, episodes 89-98. Don’t get me wrong though, I think there are a fair number of good episodes within that 9-episode stretch but unfortunately, they are surrounded by mediocre episodes that break the consistency of an otherwise exceptional arc. Madhouse’s fault lies in its adaption of the manga chapters comprising episodes 113 and 115, which were dragged out in order to have episode 116 handled by their best animation team. Episode 113 was actually well paced except for one atrocious sequence while episode 115 as a whole was generally poorly paced.\r\n\r\nA clarification about the \"slowed down pacing\" of Chimera Ant arc:\r\nIf you’ve been reading up about HxH, you’ve probably seen some people complain about the “poor pacing” during the “narration heavy episodes” of the CA arc. Well if you’re wondering how much truth is there to this statement and were going to ask me about it, my answer would be it depends.\r\n\r\nAt episode 111, the palace invasion (climax of the CA arc) begins and narration begins to play a huge role in episodes in order to (1) pack a whole level of depth into the story and (2) increase dramatic tension. Rather than a high octane \"action fest\" people would expect from a shonen arc climax, the palace invasion takes a psychological heavy route wherein a character’s thoughts and mental state are given more focus than the actual action. This psychological focus together with the narration slows down the pace considerably in the sense that episodes begin to cover a lot less in narrative time. However, despite this “slowed down pace”, the pacing of these episodes remain solid with good amount of manga chapters being covered during each of these episodes and the duration of scenes being on point (except for episodes 113 and 115 which I mentioned earlier in this review).\r\n\r\nIn the end, it depends if the narration works on you or not. If you like the psychological approach and experience an increase in suspense then you’ll have no problems with the pacing and are in for one helluvah of a ride. However, if you don’t like the psychological approach and feel that the narrator’s heavy presence breaks your immersion then you’re in for a grueling experience. Of course, there are other combinations such as liking the psychological route but not feeling the immersion or maybe the narration just didn\'t work on you completely. Well, if this happens to be the case then you’ll end up with mixed feelings. On the bright side, most people who end up watching the invasion end up enjoying the narration. However, if you happen to be one of the good number of people who end up not liking the narration don’t worry, only episodes 111-118 of the palace invasion have heavy narration. After episode 118, the narration begins to decrease and episodes eventually reach a point where they are “back to normal”.\r\n\r\nHeads up to people looking for action:\r\nAlthough I love the fighting aspect of the series and consider it to be a strong plus, I’ll leave this out there for the sake of subjectivity. HxH does not cater to everyone. Although fights in the series are well-executed, they are also short (1-10 minutes) and happen less in comparison to other battle anime. Moreover, the focus on strategy in battles might be off putting to people who prefer fights with more brawn and less brain. If you\'re expecting an action heavy series like Yu Yu Hakusho then you will be disappointed. This is because HxH is a series that relies on its story to reel in viewers. Personally, I think this is how fighting in shonen should be done. Fighting should be able to entertain and also make you think. It shouldn\'t drag on for too long at the expense of the story without leaving you underwhelmed. \r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) is an intelligent battle anime with a fantastic story, excellent characters and fights that involve a lot of strategy. Separating it from most of its genre, the series subverts shonen tropes and boasts unpredictable plot progressions that make it truly unique.\r\n\r\nOverall scores:\r\nStory: 10/10 (Outstanding)\r\nCharacters: 10/10 (Outstanding)\r\nArt: 9/10 (Great)\r\nSound: 8/10 (Great but occasionally misused)\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Extremely high)\r\nOverall: 10/10 (Masterpiece)', 'animeimages\\hxh.jpg'),

If you aren\'t I\'d recommend watching the previous part before this one so you can truly enjoy it. \r\nThis part usually divides the fandom in two: some people absolutely love it, and some hate it. I\'d say a part of it might be because of the wonky unofficial translation of the manga; I have already seen people saying they started to appreciate Vento with the anime adaptation. \r\n\r\nThe story is faithful to what you usually see in Jojo\'s bizarre adventure. It isn\'t an outstanding story but it\'s still really great but I can\'t say a lot without mentioning the manga for now but asides that I personally really like the mafia setting. \r\n\r\nYou have interesting characters that all have really distinct personalities and designs (or crazy outfits, if you want). The protagonist of the story, Giorno, appears as serious and collected but he\'s still merciless when facing enemies. I would say he has characteristic from both DIO and Jonathan. His most important trait is his determination and resolve (it even sounds funny as hell in some situations when he just blurts “I have a dream” out of nowhere).\r\n\r\nThe art style for the anime is amazing. It\'s faithful to Araki\'s art in the manga, and looks way better than the style used for the DiU anime. \r\nThe animation is beautiful and never cease to amaze me. The infamous torture dance scene in episode 7 had really interesting visuals. The battles are smooth and stands look great. We can really see that passion was put into this anime\'s realization. It\'s really pleasing to watch. \r\n\r\nThe OST is as great as the previous seasons and gave me chills multiple times. Also, the opening is sung by Coda who also sang the opening for part 2. The ending song well… sure is an interesting choice if you look at the lyrics.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, some my favorite characters in Jojo\'s bizarre adventure are in this part so I might be a little biased, but they\'re really fun and make this part unique. I love that family gang vibe that\'s around them. David Production even added some original scenes to the anime which make their presence even more entertaining. \r\n\r\nThe way they\'re introduced make them look like they\'re all a bit weird: Bruno licking Giorno\'s face 10 minutes after meeting him, Mista and his exaggerated reactions because of his fear of the number 4, Fugo and Narancia almost killing each other because of a math lesson that when wrong, and there\'s Abbacchio who\'s just tired of everyone.

I\'ll try to keep my review as spoiler-less as possible.\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\nThe film holds true to all the expectations of a Makoto Shinkai production, from heartfelt smiles to crying the 5th time within the last 30 minutes. His signature metaphorical use of trains, the idea of a hopeless and distant love, and beautiful scenery really dive you emotionally into the story, even for how generic and simple it may seem. \r\n\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story is fairly simple to understand, and very easy to guess where the story will head while watching the film. It warrants a 7 simply because I felt a lack of surprise going through the film. Be this as it may, I am also a 4 year long film major, and having seen and analyzed film tropes in an educational environment, I am confident to say that I am more proficient at guessing most stories than your typical average Joe. However, this does not take away from my overall score which I shall highlight later.\r\n\r\nArt: 10\r\nAs expected of a Makoto Shinkai film, the artwork is beautiful. The production quality is off the charts. The art in itself is enough to evoke tears, as it did for me during even the trailer. His choice of colors and use of movement and focus within the frame really help you pay attention to what you need to pay attention to, while also not skimping out and leaving out detail if your eyes do decide to stray, which I recommend you do while watching any Makoto Shinkai film for every blur, light flare, and particle floating along the screen really do add incredible amounts of emotion to the scene/screen. Among my friends we consider most Makoto Shinkai films as \"5 Wallpapers per Second\" and for good reason. \r\n\r\nSound: 9\r\nGranted I watched this film in an auditorium with hundreds of people, I can\'t give an accurate score as of writing this review. I don\'t know who did the music for the film, but during the Q&A Panel held with Shinkai, he mentioned that he messaged one of his favorite bands that he was working on a film, and wanted them to do the music, to which they said yes. \r\n\r\nEDIT 7/25/2016:\r\nThe music was done by the band RADWIMPS, a Japanese rock/alternative rock band. Some people have come to me asking whether or not this took away from the cinematic or emotional feel of the film, but in my opinion it helped in a way characterize the characters of Mitsuha and Taki. Rock music carries with it a sense of youth. Bringing that youthful feeling to the film\'s soundtrack helps to establish the sense of naivety to the characters and their interactions. It really helps establish the characters as teenagers who don\'t know or care about right from wrong, but rather would do what they feel in their heart is the right thing to do, which is exactly what motivates Mitsuha and Taki in their adventure.\r\n\r\nCharacter: 7\r\nI wouldn\'t say I have much of a complaint about main characters Taki and Mitsuha. We all can relate to the high school phase of our lives, it appeals to us because stories we read or watch in books or films set on characters that are going through this remind us of our own springtime of youth. Shinkai did a good job at portraying them and their relationships. My main gripe is that I feel they weren\'t explored enough to feel a strong sense of emotional attachment. Their lives, personalities, traits, habits, friends, lifestyles, etc are all explored in the first ~20 minutes, I personally felt that we only skimmed the surface of these characters and are forced to go further into the shallow end of a pool, only hoping that it gets deeper to actually swim around in this world of possibilities. I wanted to laugh, cry, and even relate more with the characters, but I felt that I only read about them in a story, or saw them in a film (which I did). \r\n\r\nI wanted to feel they could have actually existed, but the film seems to be a bit too reliant on cliche tropes to incite certain emotions. The feeling I felt is similar to seeing characters smiling and laughing with each other, and having to individually accept that this is enough to establish their inner motivations, time spent together, individual goals, etc. I felt like it wasn\'t enough, and just had to accept that Taki and Mitsuha were the way they were. It felt sometimes that their actions were baseless and lacking a strong motivation to be deserving of the emotion the characters poured into their actions. As if acting on a limb to do something as insane as climbing a mountain alone. I will admit that this can be disputed, however, as they are still children/teenagers, and we all do weird things for no reason growing up.\r\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10/10\r\nAs little as I felt I delved into the personalities of the characters, I did enjoy the film a lot. Shinkai\'s metaphorical use of trains just continuing to go along their routes that diverge in several ways really applies in this film, as much as it did in 5 Centimeters per Second. Everyone\'s lives diverge in different ways, things happen in dreams and are forgotten the next day, things happen in reality and are forgotten over a lifetime. I enjoyed Taki\'s and Mitsuha\'s struggles throughout the film to help each other, and as much as it made me well up tears in my eyes, I enjoyed his questioning of how much our memories make up who we are.', 'animeimages\\yourname.jpg'),

At Keisei Rosa10 in Chiba on September 17th.\r\n\r\nHaving read the manga 4 times over and crying every time, I went into the theater not expecting much tears as I have pretty much dried up my emotional experience with this manga.\r\n\r\nHowever, much to my surprise, it has been a very, very long time since I have cried that much while watching a movie. Even comparing to a similar anime film Anthem of the Heart, which surprisingly lacked the ability to really give me a tearful moment. Not to say it wasn\'t a bad movie, but if you liked that one, you will certainly like this.\r\n\r\nBe prepared for a emotional roller coaster as the movie plays with your ever so weakening heart as the movie progresses.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this is no perfect movie. The story falls short, very short in terms of character/plot progression outside of the two main characters. Perhaps it was because of the limit of having to cram the story into a 2 hour film that the writers had to cut corners. \r\n\r\nHowever, story/character development of Shoya was spot on. The movie clearly delivered his character and it was very easy to sympathize and relate to the character. Same with Shoko, though the film did leave out some specifics, the repercussions of Shoko\'s existence could be felt where one may even agree with Ueno who despised her.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the remaining characters were pretty much left out. And the overall story was ultimately incomplete because of this. With audiences who hasn\'t read the manga asking why some characters were even there. Character development with the side characters were very lacking and a lot of important details were stripped apart leaving a big hole in the story.\r\nThe only character who avoided this cut was Yuzuru who retained a lot of her details and character development.\r\n\r\nThis meant that people who haven\'t read the manga can be very confused by the end of the movie. As I had heard people talking about while leaving the theater.\r\nMany details were left out, but the film retained a lot of the core elements from the manga in puzzle pieces, allowing those who read the manga to fill in the gaps to understand what it means. But that also meant those who haven\'t were left scratching their heads.\r\n\r\nBesides the emotional road trip of your lifetime, Nagatsuka\'s moments in the film are very comedic and actually funny in a lot of ways. Often when the audience was laughing, it was usually when Nagatsuka was at his antics.\r\n\r\nAs for the art, no complaints here. Besides having some overally familiar Kyoani characters faces, Kyoto Animation has done a excellent job in representing the characters true to the manga. It\'s no Makoto Shinkai film, but the quality is nothing to scoff at. The high quality is retained throughout the entire film and no lazy production was visible.\r\n\r\nVoice acting was top notch and sounded very familiar to daily Japanese life. Though overall sound was okay. The creative use of music in the film is a bonus. Besides that, not much to write home about.\r\n\r\nThe movie tried to stay true to the manga as best as it could and in the core elements in delivering the original message that the manga had, it succeeded. But unfortunately while following the path, they dropped a lot of it\'s side content.\r\nThe movie was able to deliver the core plot of the manga.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable film and I can\'t wait for the disc release.', 'animeimages\\asilentvoice.jpg'),

Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes.', 'To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn\'t the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don\'t get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it\'s definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this show isn\'t that hard to follow. It\'s an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there\'s evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil.\r\n\r\nThe story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). \r\n\r\nThe story isn\'t nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won\'t complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could\'ve been done them just as good in one or two. There\'s also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode\'s worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it\'s cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing...\r\n\r\nFillers! Agh, I normally don\'t mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn\'t excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn\'t mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. \r\n\r\nAlso, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it\'s immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It\'s so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it\'s slightly above average. However, a lot of time it\'s slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I\'m not sure if I\'ll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators.\r\n\r\nAs a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I\'ve slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him.\r\n\r\nThe music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could\'ve used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too.\r\n\r\nThe characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he\'s so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya.\r\n\r\nThat\'s the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. \r\n\r\nI also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it\'s tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. \r\n\r\nBasically, they\'ve portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down.\r\n\r\nI have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it\'s hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show.\r\n\r\nOf course, even though there was things I didn\'t like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn\'t like it that much, though. I\'m looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!\r\n', 'animeimages\\naruto.jpg'),

I will try to give my vision on the show in the next couple of sections so please bare with me.\r\n\r\nStory\r\n\r\nThe story without giving away too much its about 2 overly intelligent pair of step brothers Sora and Shiro who are portrayed as neets. They are bored with normal life and just love to play videogames. One day they get the opportunity to join a game world where 16 races rule. In the game world extreme and weird games exist with rules varying per agreement of the players so everything is at stake. All seems peaches and cream for an interesting anime with some good story movement except that the story progression is really slow.\r\n\r\nArt\r\n\r\nTo sum it all up its really nice neon colors. Very fluid and detailed animation especially the background. I have to say that despite not enjoying the anime this is its strongest asset and its really pleasing to the eye. Madhouse really did a good job with the art and I think its top 2 of the season along with Bokura Wa mina Kawaisou. \r\n\r\nSound \r\n\r\nI don\'t think it was over the top or memorable that you want to buy the OST\'s or anything. Nothing really negative else to say by my part except that it was solid.\r\n\r\nCharacters (Only will be covering 3)\r\n\r\na) Sora - Main character, 18 year old neet who lives with his loli stepsister Shiro. Overly intelligent and with many sexual needs (according to the show). Sora quickly became an apparent icon this season for best character this season and all I can say is why? One of Sora\'s biggest strengths is also his downfall as a character and this is his super intelligence. Nothing is ever a challenge in this supposed challenging game world to him and he always seems to have a plan for everything. He tries to be too cool for my liking. I never found any of his jokes or references to be funny or entertaining only just kinda corny.\r\n\r\nb) Shiro - The other main character, 11 year old step sister of Sora. More intelligent than Sora apparently and has a brother complex. With Shiro its another case of overuse of Lolis for roles that can be fulfilled with normal characters along with Black Bullet. I don\'t get the semi naked scenes of Shiro which in this case is a minor throughout the show and it feels a bit disturbing. Shiro\'s downfall as a character to me is that she is just there to pull Sora back together and do some crazy deus ex machima to pull him out of the rare stuff that he cant (going according to plan if we follow the show\'s logic) do. \r\n\r\nc) Stephanie Dola - The other main character who\'s purpose is nothing but be exposed half naked every 4 minutes and be mocked off because of her stupidity. I have gotten slander here on MAL because apparently her role is much deeper in motivating Sora and what not if you go all philosophical with the fan boys. In reality its not and her contribution to the progression of the plot is about 0. \r\n\r\nEnjoyment\r\n\r\nWhere is the enjoyment supposed to come from this show? If its the games it did a poor job. You never get the sensation that the games are a challenge for any of the main characters because everything goes according to plan and they are never really under any concern due to Sora and Shiro\'s super Einstein like intellect. There is always something that saves them from defeat or something which gets really annoying by episode 3 or 4. \r\n\r\nLet me say that chess game in episode the span of episodes 4-5? (I maybe wrong) Is probably the worst thing you can ever watch since there is absolutely no logic behind it all and its just a complete out of thin air invention to win the game. The only game I really enjoyed where the last 2 episodes because the main characters where actually in a pinch it goes in the most predictable way of having the most useless character in the show do something. It all went according to the same generic running theme throughout the show that everything is going according to the super master plan that we won the game before we even start. How do people get any joy out of this is beyond me. \r\n\r\nThe core of the plot is really slow and its pretty much overshadowed by the fan service and stupidity of Stephanie who is pretty much just a guinea pig to try out stuff throughout the show. \r\n\r\nOverall \r\n\r\nIn the end I was really disappointed since I was looking forward to the show and all I got was just a slap in the face of how overrated, flawed and boring this show is some weeks in. The fan service outshines the plot and that is already a red flag. The plot already weak to begin with and all you get is boobs and stupidity with slow progression its not really ideal.', 'animeimages\\ngnl.jpg');

The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.\r\n\r\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece', 'There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show. \"I don\'t like the art style\" or \"I\'ve seen the dub - NO THANKS.\" I\'m guilty of both of these myself. But if there\'s one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it\'s that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece. For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is. If you\'ve suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh. They butchered it, there\'s really no other way to put it. They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series. FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I\'ve seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go.\r\n\r\nAs for the art style, it\'s true, it\'s completely different from almost anything else I\'ve seen. Much more \"cartoonish\" and maybe not what you\'d expect from an anime. Despite that, you end up loving it. I wouldn\'t even say that you have to \"get used to it\" because it\'s not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way. It didn\'t even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I\'d experienced before. Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can\'t remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have. Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at.\r\n\r\nNow that we\'ve got those two points out of the way...\r\n\r\nOne Piece is actually one of the best shows I\'ve ever seen, anime or otherwise. The plot is pretty basic at first. Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure \'one piece\' and become Pirate King, and he\'s looking for a crew to sail with him. You\'ll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them. They\'re all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities. They form one very quirky crew that\'s always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams. Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they\'re just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew. Not one character is left out or feels like they\'re there for no reason. Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these \'purposes\' often resurface at later points in the series. No detail is left untouched, and you\'ll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses.\r\n\r\nThe plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE. Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it\'s definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you\'re swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you\'ll ever watch. The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC. But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it\'s lighthearted, humorous edge. The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few. There\'s always a wonderful balance of action and humor.\r\n\r\nOne Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. I\'ve definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. And underneath everything, there\'s always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA.\r\n\r\nIn a word, One Piece is perfect. And perhaps I\'m just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say? It\'s been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end. It is, simply put, amazing.\r\n\r\nSo why should you watch One Piece?\r\n\r\nBecause you\'re missing out on one hell of a fantastic show if you don\'t at least give it a try.', 'animeimages\\onepiece.jpg'),
(15, 'One Punch Man', NULL, 'One Punch Man', 'series', 1, 12, 8.71, 'Madhouse', 'Finished', '00:23:00', '2015-10-05', 'The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.\r\n\r\nThis all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama\'s disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he\'ll become popular in the process.\r\n', 'Going back to One Punch Man, I really thought of something. Something that can make or break this show to several of its viewers. And that\'s the joke. The one prominent singular joke. \r\n\r\nI\'m not saying this is going to be a completely balanced review. And most of you might get upset over that fact, and even start to hate me for it too. And I can understand why. I would hate it if someone didn\'t provide both sides to the argument for my favorite show, but keep in mind that I am not authoritative force, and I cannot dictate how or what you should think. For all you know, you might just stumble a 4 paragraph post by me describing how shoving hotdogs up your ass is actually a good thing. But I\'m hoping that maybe next time you go to the grill, you can ponder on what you\'re going to do with that hotdog. Or maybe you still won\'t do that, but you\'ll at least know why some people might like sticking hotdogs up their ass. But anyways, let\'s get on with this review.\r\n\r\nOne Punch Man has got to be one of the most commonly talked about show I\'ve seen this year, even impacting the smash community when one of the smash player\'s shaved their beard and started using Ryu. In all honesty, how many shows can you say do that? But does this fulfill the hype, and is this the savior of anime?\r\n\r\nIf you are like me, and expected One Punch Man to be a satire, then you will be disappointed. Rather than making fun of its tropes directly, One Punch Man parodies it instead by over-exaggerating them to the point where it becomes funny. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily, but there are problems with that. With the already ridiculous start of the series, it makes it hard to enjoy the jokes when they are virtually indistinguishable. You can\'t top off something so exaggerated, similar to how you can\'t top off beating an enemy with a single punch. Because of this, as the series went on, the joke lost its charm as it wasn\'t special anymore. After seeing a couple of episodes, you know what to expect from it, which really damaged the comedy effect. And yes, the final episodes did stray away from that, but even that was just a elongated scene of what was soon going to happen. If you really look at it, it was just Saitama getting beaten up with a variety of attacks.\r\n\r\nThe problem of One Punch Man getting repetitive may seem like a small thing, but in fact, it really isn\'t. When a comedy starts to get unappealing, there isn\'t much that can save that. The parody is all that One Punch Man seemed to offer, and if you don\'t like that, than you definitely won\'t like the show. \r\n\r\nNear the end, it was hinted that the focus will eventually shift from the parody aspect to the side characters, something that would benefit the series as the more \"Slice of Life\" aspects where the strong suit of One Punch Man, but for now, the first season is all we got.\r\n\r\nYou could say that being repetitive and anticlimactic is the point of One Punch Man, and it in itself is actually also parodying the repetitive nature of most action shows, but I disagree. There should be something that would want to make the watcher come back for more. Your daily life as a human being isn\'t characterized by the same exact thing each time. Maybe the steps building up to \'the punchline\' are different, or maybe you don\'t exactly engage with \'the punchline\' each time. The moment in this case is the same exact thing, with the only differences being how the villains look or where the fight is taking place. What kind of show is engaging, but doesn\'t have an engaging story? Even if that was the point, how is it fun to watch the same thing 12 times?\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the parody aspect of it, then the repetitiveness of the joke shouldn\'t be a problem for you, but if you wanted a bit more than just that, then you won\'t be getting that from One Punch Man.\r\n\r\nIf anyone tells you that the animation of One Punch Man is bad, then they\'re just trying to shit on the show for the sake of shitting on the show. Though inconsistent at times, the show looked amazing when it called for a fight scene, and average at least when it called for a more Slice of Life moment.\r\n\r\nThe music did a good job in making you hyped and excited for each fight and episodes. It\'s not something I could see anyone listening outside from this anime, but it\'s good nevertheless in enhancing the show.\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t much to say in such a simple show like this. I\'ll ask once again if it wasn\'t clear the first 100 times. Did you like the joke, or did you not? After you found that out, you\'ll know what to do.', 'animeimages\\onepunchman.jpg'),

She turns out to be an actress on hiatus, Mai Sakurajima, who is also his senior at the school. For some reason, no one else can see this enchanting girl. How did she become invisible...? As Sakuta searches for answers to help Mai, they spend more time together, and he eventually learns of her hidden feelings...\r\n\r\nThis is an unusual story that takes place in a town of bright skies and glistening seas, where Sakuta encounters various intriguing girls.', 'I am sure that several spectators started to watch the show after seeing the cover art and the Bunny Girl title. However, you aren’t going to watch a girl wearing a bunny outfit all the time … sorry to disappoint. Also, the audience can relate the anime with Bakemonogatari, Sakurada Reset to name some and the similarity between the main characters\' behavior, the mystery in the plot, and the supernatural events.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as a positive aspect about the series, we have the characters chemistry and an entertaining plot. The story is interesting and mysterious, it could be a bit confusing for some, but it has a taint that boosts the characters interactions and hooks the spectators with good pacing. In this anime, the author cared to develop a world where the school is the center, and the events affect the characters and the interaction with the outside world. \r\n\r\nWe have two main characters, but their personalities differ a lot, so the contrast makes the characters more vivid. They aren\'t the typical high schoolers with the same generic background as most of the high school series. The main male character Sakuta has a nice introvert attitude and with an awkward past and could be a weirdo. Furthermore, he is ironic, sarcastic and with some sense of humor executed flawlessly. The main female character aka the Bunny Girl Mai (her face looks like a bunny :3) is a famous actress but with a mature air that is not normal in this kind of series. I am finding the background very interesting, but she will experience some unexpectant events related to a certain syndrome that I am not going to explain because we have only seen four episodes and this syndrome will affect the plot outcome in several ways. \r\n\r\nThe art is clean and precious. I am surprised by the quality and color management. However, it is not perfect, and some camera angles could have been improved, but you won\'t notice them. \r\nThe OP (Kimi no Sei) is marvelous. I think the peggies did a great work performing the song; the lyrics are magnificent and have a great score that helps to follow them. \r\n\r\nLastly, the series is good so far, albeit there are some plot mysteries related to the “puberty syndrome” that need to be revealed and explained but there are good theories in MAL’s forum.', 'animeimages\\butayarou.jpg'),

However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his world and sets him on a journey to face music again.\r\n\r\nBased on the manga series of the same name, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso approaches the story of Kousei\'s recovery as he discovers that music is more than playing each note perfectly, and a single melody can bring in the fresh spring air of April.', 'Hers was a white lie built on a grain of truth that snowballed as one lie after the other piled up. At first it was only hers, but then it became something that the two of them shared together – like a secret, a world upon which no other could encroach. He may have been “Friend A,” and she “the girl that loves my best friend,” but they were masquerading around a truth that neither one could openly admit because ultimately, the truth was much more painful.\r\n\r\nYour Lie in April is a deceitfully masterful series that initially appears light-hearted and colorful, its palette boasting pastels that lend to the idea of it being another romantic comedy. Yet the moment we step past the disillusionment that it casts upon us by its false prefaces, we quickly realize that what we have immersed ourselves in is actually a tragedy in the making.\r\n\r\nTragic not because of a single element but because of all of its parts, and yet at the end of everything, this isn’t a series about tragedy. It is a series about learning to heal, learning to move on, and learning to accept the parts of ourselves that we’d rather pretend aren’t there. Part of that is accepting that sometimes we need a helping hand to take that first step. Part of it is learning to say goodbye when the time comes.\r\n\r\nWhat is so compelling about the storyline is that it’s not merely an adventure into first love, it delves into the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder, childhood abuse, and chronic illness. It doesn’t paint any of these as artistic or tragically beautiful—they are horrible, they twist people, they ruin the best moments, and they have a long-lasting impact.\r\n\r\nNo one is completely black-and-white; everyone has their short-comings, fleshed out in full before our eyes. They have their hang-ups, their strengths, their struggles—and it’s in these characters that this series really takes off in full stride. It would be enough for them to be multifaceted with equal amounts of depth, but they take it a step further in painting the reality of youth.\r\n\r\nOlder anime fans may critically analyze the series as an unrealistic approach to young teenagers, but that pessimism overlooks the reality of what it was like for us to be that age. We were all that point when we found our first love, when we thought it was forever, when we poured our passion into something that ultimately would not come to fruition or last. That’s what being young is about—and that’s what Your Lie in April gives us. \r\n\r\nGranted that it may veer a bit over-dramatic at times in its representation of youth; there are moments of symbolism or hyperbole so overt that the cheesiness makes you shift a little uncomfortably in your seat (but I promise it’s not enough to gag you). Given that this is, however, a rather common trope that runs in series with heavier themes, it’s not necessarily a huge setback for an otherwise solid series. In the end, it is intended to be a fictional representation that conveys more than just what can be summarized in a few sentences or less.\r\n\r\nThe sound is completely on point, and the soundtrack artfully matches the emotions intended to be represented in each scene. From the actual classical music to the opening and ending, everything fits in like a jigsaw puzzle to give a full, satisfying final piece. When the characters analyze someone’s playing as harsh, rigid, and stilted, we can hear this—whether we are knowledgeable about music or not. Your Lie in April conveys emotion to us not just visually but aurally as well.\r\n\r\nThe animation is wonderful with bright, vibrant colors that bring the characters fully to life. There is an amazing, visually perceivable transition for the characters as time passes, particularly in regards to Kaori as the series moves on. It occasionally has some stilted moments but nothing outrageously noticeable to detract from the overall quality.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Your Lie in April is a story that starts out of the gates moving a bit slowly, but the pace matches the tone of the series. Structurally, it is a solid story of youth that dramatizes some aspects but never distracts from the intended message. On top of its other strong points, it’s aurally and visually a joy to the senses – and to anyone appreciative of a series willing to realistically approach the conflict of childhood abuse and the resulting trauma in a positive way. It’s not without a few setbacks, but in the end, Your Lie in April fashions itself to be a stand-out romance series that reminds us that while some relationships may be transient and brief, some people will come into our lives at just the right time for just long enough to touch us in a way we never thought possible.', 'animeimages\\yourlieinapril.jpg'),

Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.', '“No one knows what the future holds. That’s why its potential is infinite.”\r\nOkabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It’s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it’s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There’s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.\r\nBut why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nSteins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a “mad scientist” who spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured – and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers’ attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either – in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThis is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn’t a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn’t jaw-dropping. However, this doesn’t mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible – and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nAmazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nWhat can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There’s hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you’ll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\r\nSteins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don’t really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn’t refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime – but that’s not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won\'t waste your precious time.

With the aid of \"NerveGear\" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.\r\n\r\nKazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed \"Kirito,\" is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game\'s creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.\r\n\r\nIn order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.', '--The review contains minor spoilers--\r\n\r\nSince I\'ve seen a plethora of scores of 10 for this show, I thought I\'d write what I feel is a more realistic review for this show. Sword Art Online is more or less the equivalent of a fanfiction in it\'s writing and quality. Whether people want to overlook it or not is up to the individual, but I believe it fails at the fundamentals for writing a good story. This review will go into details as to my opinions on why I feel this way. \r\n\r\n1) Story - This is first major problem is the show. Let\'s start from the beginning shall we. The first arc consists of 14 episodes. The first 2 episodes are honestly pretty good and set up the plot of the show that should follow. You\'re introduced to the main characters and it shows mmo style of play. I mean with 2 episodes that are amazing, surely what follows will be more of the adventures of the main characters and these mmo boss fights...right? Wrong. What follows are 5 completely irrelevant side character episodes and unnecessary terrible time skips that ruin any sense of a story the first 2 episodes set up. So due to some illogical reason, we\'re now down to 7 episodes to tell the rest of this story. Still doable right? RIGHT? Wrong again. The series wastes another 2 1/2 episodes on pointless filler garbage. So there you have it over half of first part of the story has nothing to do with the overall plot. Well what about the other episodes you ask? The remaining \"plot\" episodes are filled with deus ex machina in its purest form. Even the finale of the first season makes absolutely no sense. This isn\'t a fantasy world, it\'s a freaking video game, you can\'t have miracles here. So that concludes my issues with season 1, which the majority of SAO fans consider to be the best part....Yeh you heard me, the 2nd part is even worse.\r\nWithout going into spoilers, the 2nd part of the series takes place in a different setting, with a mostly new cast aside from our main hero. This part of the series probably deserves the award for most unnecessary story in the history of anime. This arc is pretty much a mario game. Our hero must save the princess in the castle. Not really much to say about it. Oh yeh deus ex machina finale here too...oh and there\'s an incest subplot...for some reason. This concludes the plot section. I think I\'m being pretty generous with a 4 here. \r\n\r\n2) Art - The art is fantastic. Colorful characters, bosses (the few we see), and settings are all here. It\'s easily worth an 8.\r\n\r\n3) Sound - Again fantastic. Nothing wrong with it at all. 8.\r\n\r\n4)Characters - Here we go...This is easily the worst part of the series. I\'ll separate the main characters and lump together the not so main characters.\r\n\r\nKirito/Kazuto - The main character of this show is the epitome of the current definition of a \"Gary Stu\". He has no personality whatsoever. He is good at everything he tries for no reason. He\'s an amazing player, an super sleuth, a ladies man, and a master hacker. You name it, he can do it. There\'s no reason given for this other than he\'s just that good. Girls all love him, guys want to be him, and villains are jealous of him. He also solos MMO boss fights...yeh wrap your head around that one. Side note - I often see people claim they love this show because they\'re hardcore gamers. I have to say as an avid gamer myself I find this show to be insulting. Unless you\'ve hacked or cheated , I don\'t understand why you\'re content with a character who does. Side note over. \r\n\r\nAsuna - The main female lead/most blatant waifu character ever. Asuna is introduced as a strong player who can stand on her own with Kirito, that is for the first couple episodes. Once she reappears she barely does anything other than cook for Kirito. That\'s right, her ass stays in the kitchen, while Kirito does all the important stuff. In part 2 she does absolutely nothing...seriously. She again has no original personality...textbook Tsundere. \r\n\r\nYui - This character is terrible in all senses of the word. She\'s walking deus ex machina, nothing more. This character should be hated by any gamer, since she\'s a cheat device, who adds nothing to the story. \r\n\r\nVillains (minor spoilers) - There are 2 major villains in this series and they\'re both terrible. The first one forgets his motives for doing everything in part 1 and the part 2 one is so comically evil he can\'t even be taken seriously. \r\n\r\nOther Characters/ Who the hell cares - The female characters all want to have sex with Kirito and have no personality past this. The male characters don\'t get to do anything because Kirito hogs the show from everyone. That\'s really all there is to say about that.\r\n\r\nSuguha - This is Kirito\'s sister. She honestly has layers and was a plus to the show in my opinion. I don\'t know why she\'s in this show, she doesn\'t belong in it...\r\n\r\nSo yeh, Gary Stu and Waifu - these characters are pathetic (1).\r\n\r\n5) Enjoyment - Needless to say I didn\'t enjoy it. Poor show (3)\r\n\r\n6) Overall - This show has so many fans, and I really don\'t know why. Its plot is rushed and terrible. Its characters so flat, it\'s almost funny...almost. Its romance is highly misogynistic and terribly developed. I felt insulted watching this, and don\'t understand how any could like this show. Even Gamers.', 'animeimages\\swordartonline.jpg'),

Broken free from ordinary, stale past life, his fresh adventure in a fantasy world as a slime monster with unique abilities begins.', '6 episodes in, and I can firmly say that Tensei Slime (or TenSura for short) is the isekai series to end all isekai series that has since premiered this year, and with Tate no Yuusha on the horizon to come next season, we\'re all set for (FINALLY) THE good isekai series to come out with full force.\r\n\r\nThis is a prelim and I\'ll just keep it short, because this is just too good. A slime, saving the entire isekai genre? I can live with that!\r\n\r\nStory and characters:\r\nPretty much how EVERY isekai series start with the MC, some XX year-old Don\'t-care-what\'s-his-name got his life lost in the real world, and then transported (or how I like to call it isekai-ed) into the fantasy world, but the character himself (or ITself) is really damn unique, taking in the form of a slime, which we hadn\'t seen for majority of isekai stories out there which are trying their \"failing\" best to be outlandish. And when do we see evidence trying to be broken right on the first try \"RIP to MC\'s computer*???\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, for what has been presented, Rimuru the slime reincarated itself is really quite the character I never expected at one point but it really works wonders, being able to do all things that slimes usually do. And if you thought that Rimuru is OP, don\'t, because troubles will come in the next 3/4 of the show. And for those concerning the adaptation, it has been clarified from MAL that it\'s the manga, NOT the LN (which is based on the manga itself also). The characters, startting with Tsundere dragon Veldora to the goblin (Goblin Slayer, you\'re NOT welcome here T.T), werewolf and dwarf tribes were all quite interesting and this was all that I\'d expected and more. Interactions don\'t feel as forced, but still has its comedic moments with the Great Sage-Rimuru analysis and such.\r\n\r\nArt and animation:\r\nA new refurbished logo for a flourishing studio. I can honestly believe that even with some worrying staff behind TenSura (such as director Yasuhito Kikuchi for his work on the Infinite Stratos series and such), this is studio 8-bit\'s Magnum Opus that is second to the awesome adaptation of the Grisala VN series. The artwork is simply great and captivating and the animation is top-notch too. Simply just one of the great components that flourish the qualities of the manga-translated adaptation to its best.\r\n\r\nMusic:\r\nI\'m just gonna take it straight: Where in the world will you get SO MUCH reveal just by looking at the OP and ED? It\'s like we\'re only just started, and immediately everyone notices it so much that the hype train just went up by a few notches! Besides that, people were expressing a bit over concerns that both the songs for the OP and ED are good, but if swapped around. I really thought that the OP was great for starters on the series itself, and TRUE\'s ED was leaps better, but really worked well as the ED. Regardless, this was a top-notch OST.\r\n\r\nVerdict:\r\nIf you\'re reading my review and haven\'t watched this amazing isekai series, then what the hell are you doing? Go binge-watch the XX amount of episodes you have left out! Truly a great start to beat the Monday blues.', 'animeimages\\slime.jpg'),
(16, 'Tokyo Ghoul', 'Toukyou Kushu', 'Tokyo Ghoul', 'series', 4, 42, 7.99, 'Studio Pierrot', 'Airing', '00:23:00', '2014-07-04', 'Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city—a place where vicious creatures called “ghouls” exist alongside humans. The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans and blend in with society.\r\n\r\nBased on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken Kaneki, a shy, bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However, Rize is not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into the dark depths of the ghouls\' inhuman world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.', 'Remember when you were little and you tried to bake that really awesome cake following the instructions on a cooking-book and ended up forgetting half the ingredients or using the wrong ones and the cake looked like complete shit and shit was all over the kitchen and then your mother walked in and slapped you across the face? Whether or not you remember, if you can picture that scenario then you can picture how Studio Pierrot\'s attempt at adapting Tokyo Ghoul into an anime unfolded. \r\n\r\nLets actually start off with the \"good\" in Tokyo Ghoul. Why? Because it\'s one sentence long so lets get it out of the way shall we.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is decent. The opening theme is good, and the ending theme is pretty catchy. Ok so that was two sentences. \r\n\r\nI\'m going to fess up now and admit that I have not read the manga although I\'m aware that it\'s a lot better and that they crammed 60 chapters into 12 episodes. This review will be based on the anime alone, which I believe is more correct then the people giving this adaption a break solely for their admiration of the manga. \r\n\r\nThe worst aspect of Tokyo Ghoul are the characters and their development. Frankly I\'m not going to talk about any of the characters aside from Kaneki because there is nothing to say about them after 12 episodes.\r\nKaneki is worth talking about because he is a boy born with a vagina..oh and he is a also a half-ghoul, almost forgot about that. As the MC of Tokyo Ghoul, Kaneki\'s main role is to disappoint us to death, cry a lot, and bitch a lot about how much he sucks.\r\n\r\nWith the characters being so dreadful, the anime relied heavily on the plot and the violence. The plot is very broad in the anime: Humans vs Ghouls and Ghouls vs Ghouls. At least that\'s what I got from 12 episodes adapted from 60 chapters. The violence is censored so that sucks, but apparently the DVD versions will be uncensored..cool, anyways moving on. The most pretentious thing about Tokyo Ghoul are the attempts at emotionally moving the audience by having some characters we know nothing about die and seeing other characters feel sad while the soundtrack playing assures us that this is indeed meant to be an emotional scene...awkward.\r\n\r\nSo about right now you\'re probably thinking to yourself that I don\'t have much to say about this anime. I just felt like reviewing this anime cause I wanted to write down that whole baking a cake comparison after which my passion ran out. This is much like the folks at Studio Pierrot. They had no passion whatsoever in the making of this anime, taking advantage of the fact that the manga is extremely popular and doing the most minimalist job possible. \r\n\r\nWith all this I thought I would take joy in witnessing how badly this train-wreck could end, and to my surprise they actually took that pleasure from me as well. The last 10 minutes of the last episode were legitimately entertaining. Right at the end, the show introduced moral ideas worthy of involving the audience and I found myself enjoying Tokyo Ghoul for the first time. What a bunch of trolls eh.', 'animeimages\\tokyoghoul.jpg');
